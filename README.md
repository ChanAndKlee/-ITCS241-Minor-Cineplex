## Detail
A group term project that has a main objective to apply the RDBMS and lessons in class with the real existing business domain.
Our selected business domain is Entertainment which will be focused on the process of buying and selling tickets in cinemas.
It covers designing the ER Diagram and Relational Schema, implementing it on MySQL, and querying the information
to ensure the integrity of the overall system. It consisted of 2 Phases:

  ### Phase 1:
  - Business Overview
  - List of all ENtities with Attributes
  - Business Rules and Constraints (1:1, 1:M, N:M)
  - ER Diagram (ERD) using Crow's Foot Notation
  
  ### Phase 2:
  - Revised ERD
  - Relational Schema
  - Data Dictionary
  - Basic and Advanced Queries
